# Netsuite Source dbt Package ([Docs](https://fivetran.github.io/dbt_netsuite_source/))
# 📣 What does this dbt package do?
<!--section="netsuite_source_model"-->
- Materializes [Netsuite staging tables](https://fivetran.github.io/dbt_netsuite_source/#!/overview/netsuite_source/models/?g_v=1&g_e=seeds) which leverage data in the format described by [this ERD](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/netsuite#schemainformation). These staging tables clean, test, and prepare your Netsuite data from [Fivetran's connector](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/netsuite) for analysis by doing the following:
  - Name columns for consistency across all packages and for easier analysis
  - Adds freshness tests to source data
  - Adds column-level testing where applicable. For example, all primary keys are tested for uniqueness and non-null values.
- Generates a comprehensive data dictionary of your netsuite data through the [dbt docs site](https://fivetran.github.io/dbt_netsuite_source/).
- These tables are designed to work simultaneously with our [Netsuite transformation package](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_netsuite).
<!--section-end-->

# 🎯 How do I use the dbt package?
## Step 1: Prerequisites
To use this dbt package, you must have At least either one Fivetran **Netsuite** (netsuite.com) or **Netsuite2** (netsuite2) connector syncing the respective tables to your destination:
### Netsuite.com
- accounts
- accounting_periods
- accounting_books
- consolidated_exchange_rates
- currencies
- customers
- classes
- departments
- expense_accounts
- income_accounts
- items
- locations
- partners
- transaction_lines
- transactions
- subsidiaries
- vendors
- vendor_types

### Netsuite2
- account
- accounttype
- accountingbooksubsidiary
- accountingperiodfiscalcalendar
- accountingperiod
- accountingbook
- consolidatedexchangerate
- currency
- customer
- classification
- department
- entity
- entityaddress
- item
- job
- location
- locationmainaddress
- transactionaccountingline
- transactionline
- transaction
- subsidiary
- vendor
- vendorcategory

### Database Compatibility
This package is compatible with either a **BigQuery**, **Snowflake**, **Redshift**, **PostgreSQL**, or **Databricks** destination.

### Databricks dispatch configuration
If you are using a Databricks destination with this package, you must add the following (or a variation of the following) dispatch configuration within your `dbt_project.yml`. This is required in order for the package to accurately search for macros within the `dbt-labs/spark_utils` then the `dbt-labs/dbt_utils` packages respectively.
```yml
dispatch:
  - macro_namespace: dbt_utils
    search_order: ['spark_utils', 'dbt_utils']
```

## Step 2: Install the package (skip if also using the `Netsuite` transformation package)
If you  are **not** using the [Netsuite transformation package](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_netsuite), include the following package version in your `packages.yml` file. If you are installing the transform package, the source package is automatically installed as a dependency.
> TIP: Check [dbt Hub](https://hub.getdbt.com/) for the latest installation instructions or [read the dbt docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/package-management) for more information on installing packages.
```yaml
packages:
  - package: fivetran/netsuite_source
    version: [">=0.9.0", "<0.10.0"]
```

## Step 3: Define Netsuite.com or Netsuite2 Source
As of April 2022 Fivetran made available a new Netsuite connector which leverages the Netsuite2 endpoint opposed to the original Netsuite.com endpoint. This package is designed to run for either or, not both. By default the `netsuite_data_model` variable for this package is set to the original `netsuite` value which runs the netsuite.com version of the package. If you would like to run the package on Netsuite2 data, you may adjust the `netsuite_data_model` variable to run the `netsuite2` version of the package.
```yml
vars:
    netsuite_data_model: netsuite2 #netsuite by default
```

## Step 4: Define database and schema variables
By default, this package runs using your destination and the `netsuite` schema. If this is not where your Netsuite data is (for example, if your netsuite schema is named `netsuite_fivetran`), add the following configuration to your root `dbt_project.yml` file:

```yml
vars:
    netsuite_database: your_destination_name
    netsuite_schema: your_schema_name 
```

## Step 5: Disable models for non-existent sources (Netsuite2 only)
It's possible that your Netsuite connector does not sync every table that this package expects. If your syncs exclude certain tables, it is because you either don't use that feature in Netsuite or actively excluded some tables from your syncs. To disable the corresponding functionality in the package, you must add the relevant variables. By default, all variables are assumed to be true. Add variables for only the tables you would like to disable:
```yml
vars:
    netsuite2__multibook_accounting_enabled: false # True by default. Disable `accountingbooksubsidiary` and `accountingbook` if you are not using the Multi-Book Accounting feature
    netsuite2__using_exchange_rate: false #True by default. Disable `exchange_rate` if you don't utilize exchange rates. If you set this variable to false and are using the `netsuite` transformation package, ensure it is scoped globally so that the `netsuite` package can access it as well.  
    netsuite2__using_vendor_categories: false # True by default. Disable `vendorcategory` if you don't categorize your vendors
    netsuite2__using_jobs: false # True by default. Disable `job` if you don't use jobs

```
> **Note**: The Netsuite dbt package currently only supports disabling transforms of [Multi-Book Accounting](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/saas/netsuite/ns-online-help/book_3831565332.html) related tables (`accountingbooksubsidiary` and `accountingbook`), the `vendorcategory` source table, and the `job` source table. Please create an issue to request additional tables and/or [features](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/saas/netsuite/ns-online-help/bridgehead_N233872.html) to exclude. 
> 
> To determine if a table or field is activated by a feature, access the [Records Catalog](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/saas/netsuite/ns-online-help/article_159367781370.html).

## (Optional) Step 6: Additional configurations
<details><summary>Expand for configurations</summary>

### Passing Through Additional Fields
This package includes all source columns defined in the macros folder. You can add more columns using our pass-through column variables. These variables allow for the pass-through fields to be aliased (`alias`) and casted (`transform_sql`) if desired, but not required. Datatype casting is configured via a sql snippet within the `transform_sql` key. You may add the desired sql while omitting the `as field_name` at the end and your custom pass-though fields will be casted accordingly. Use the below format for declaring the respective pass-through variables:

```yml
vars:
    accounts_pass_through_columns: 
        - name: "new_custom_field"
          alias: "custom_field"
    classes_pass_through_columns: 
        - name: "this_field"
    departments_pass_through_columns: 
        - name: "unique_string_field"
          alias: "field_id"
          transform_sql: "cast(field_id as string)"
    transactions_pass_through_columns: 
        - name: "that_field"
    transaction_lines_pass_through_columns: 
        - name: "other_id"
          alias: "another_id"
          transform_sql: "cast(another_id as int64)"
    customers_pass_through_columns: 
        - name: "customer_custom_field"
          alias: "customer_field"
    locations_pass_through_columns: 
        - name: "location_custom_field"
    subsidiaries_pass_through_columns: 
        - name: "sub_field"
          alias: "subsidiary_field"
    consolidated_exchange_rates_pass_through_columns: 
        - name: "consolidate_this_field"
    vendors_pass_through_columns: 
        - name: "vendors_custom_field"
          alias: "vendors_field"
    items_pass_through_columns: 
        - name: "items_custom_field"
          alias: "items_field"
```
### Change the build schema
By default, this package builds the Netsuite staging models within a schema titled (`<target_schema>` + `_netsuite_source`) in your destination. If this is not where you would like your netsuite staging data to be written to, add the following configuration to your root `dbt_project.yml` file:

```yml
models:
    netsuite_source:
      +schema: my_new_schema_name # leave blank for just the target_schema
```
    
### Change the source table references
If an individual source table has a different name than the package expects, add the table name as it appears in your destination to the respective variable:
> IMPORTANT: See this project's [`dbt_project.yml`](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_netsuite_source/blob/main/dbt_project.yml) variable declarations to see the expected names.
    
```yml
vars:
    # For all Netsuite source tables
    netsuite_<default_source_table_name>_identifier: your_table_name 

    # For all Netsuite2 source tables
    netsuite2_<default_source_table_name>_identifier: your_table_name 
```
### Override the data models variable
This package is designed to run **either** the Netsuite.com or Netsuite2 data models. However, for documentation purposes, an additional variable `netsuite_data_model_override` was created to allow for both data model types to be run at the same time by setting the variable value to `netsuite`. This is only to ensure the [dbt docs](https://fivetran.github.io/dbt_netsuite_source/) (which is hosted on this repository) is generated for both model types. While this variable is provided, we recommend you do not adjust the variable and instead change the `netsuite_data_model` variable to fit your configuration needs.
